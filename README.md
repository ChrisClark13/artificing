# Artificing 


Artificing is a MineCraft Modification created by ChrisClark13, with help from Cyntain. The original idea was thought up by ChrisClark13. The Mod uses Forge, MCP and MultiSlot API ([Click Here to see more](https://github.com/ChrisClark13/artificing/wiki/APIs-and-Decomplier)). 


The basic idea of Artificing is to improve upon the enchanting system; by adding runes and other magical items/blocks. ([Click here to see more](https://github.com/ChrisClark13/artificing/wiki/Features))


The Mod is in early alpha, and is under heavy development. Not all features have been finalised, and features are subject to change.
